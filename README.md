# Math579-FEM-Project
Project for Math 579 creating software package for the solution of PDEs using the finite element method

The goals:

- (Soft skills) Learn about object-oriented programming, developing software collaboratively, creating libraries in Python
- Learn about meshing algorithms and data-structures, local polynomial interpolation, adaptivity.
